This is a project in which Things are the C# object which mean the devices like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NodeMCU, etc. Pin is GPIO object that can be configured directly by the hardware user. Pin object carries the information regarding the pin when the step signal is created, how long the step signal is maintained and when the step signal is destroyed (using timer to say it simply). This timer functionality is useful for the pin which is triggers devices like water pump. User can also turn on and off devices remotely without bothering timer functionality. So all in all, it is an IoT application. For any user, their IoT home application is populated on the screen. Since, this project was done in 2017, when I was new to .NET, I haven't implemented Web Sockets in this project. You can always download my project and add one and create a pull request if you want to contribute. Thank you.
